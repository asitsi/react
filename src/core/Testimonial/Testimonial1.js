                    Dive to learn helped me to achieve my goals.I cleared UGC
                    NET exam in December 2019. Earlier i was very confused about
                    how to start my preparation... But then I got to know about
                    this platform not only they provided me the content but a
                    pathway to move forword with my preparation with proper
                    guidance and assistance from all my teachers. But remember
                    if you have the will then you can achieve anything in life
                    provided you should carry that passion and consistency with
                    your preparation. S i big thank you to all my teachers who
                    motivated me. I am glad i came across this platform. ”
